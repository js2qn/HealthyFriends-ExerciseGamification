#### Log Workouts 
Users can log their workouts by activity type and date, and they can input their calories burned or use our estimation feature to fill in that field. Workouts will be added to their profile and they can easily see their progress by date in the chart. 

#### View Achievements and Set Goals
Users can also set their own goals, in both qualitative and quantitative terms. For example they can set new goals to burn X calories in a given time period or just something like “exercise today”. Please note the input types as well when using this feature! Users receive one point added to their lifetime points for every fitness log added. 

#### Leaderboard

#### Forum 
The Healthy Friends forum is where users can post their thoughts, advice, or ask questions to other Healthy Friends users.
